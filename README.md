# Home-Credit-Defualt-Risk-Project

This notebook is built on the problem and data of Home Credit predicting default risk. The data and Kaggle information can be found at this link https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/code.

The data used in this project is regarding an individual's characteristics; income, occupation, family size, etc. There is a train and test file with similar variables. There is also data about an individual's transactions, balances, and other financial information.

Home Credit wants to help customers have a good experience by more accurately predicting who should be approved with the ability to pay back a loan and those who should be rejected who will be unable to pay it back.

Having our model provide correct predictions on an individual’s loan payment abilities will enable the following outcomes.
•	Better allocate resources
•	Increase revenue and profits
•	Decrease risk
•	Provide better customer experiences
•	Increase creditability and competitiveness in the industry


We will build a supervised categorical model, predicting whether someone should be approved for a loan (1 meaning should not be approved, 0 meaning should be approved). We will use the data from Kaggle about the individual, their transactions, and other financial data. We’ll explore the data, clean it, create visualizations, and perform feature engineering to help maximize the effectiveness of our model.
