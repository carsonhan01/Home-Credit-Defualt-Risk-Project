# Model 1: Logistic Regression

I modeled logistic regression to help predict a categorical variable for TARGET which contains the values of 1 and 0. This can then be used on the training fold data to verify correct predictions. I initially did a logistic regression with all variables, then identified variables with a low p-value and selected those for this model.

```{r, results='hide'}
#Build a logistic regression models using varialbes with low p-values
default_model <- app_train %>% glm(formula = TARGET ~ AMT_REQ_CREDIT_BUREAU_QRT + AMT_REQ_CREDIT_BUREAU_DAY + AMT_REQ_CREDIT_BUREAU_MON + DAYS_LAST_PHONE_CHANGE + DEF_30_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE  + EXT_SOURCE_2 + EXT_SOURCE_3 + WEEKDAY_APPR_PROCESS_START + FLAG_OWN_CAR, family = "binomial")

#Show the logistic regression model
summary(default_model)
```
